# submit.py
Script to submit to [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)

    Submit an array of jobs to the SLURM system, to be handled by 'go_sim.py'
    
# Syntax:
    
    submit.py ARG [mem=????] [queue=????] [hours=INT] [days=INT] [cpu=INT] file1 [file2] [file3] [...]
    
ARG is passed as arguments to 'go_sim.py' (please check go_sim.py help),
and you must use quotes if you have multiple arguments to group them together.
    
Unless specified otherwise, the queue is 'medium_priority'.
The amount of requested memory (default=2G) should be specified in MB:
   mem=1024 (for 1 GB)
   mem=512  (for 512 MB)
   ...
